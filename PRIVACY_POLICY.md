# Privacy Policy for Omnisearch Extension

**Last updated: January 2025**

## Overview
Omnisearch is a browser extension that allows users to search multiple platforms simultaneously. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information.

## Information We Collect
- **Search Engine Preferences**: We store your configured search engines and their enabled/disabled status locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API.
- **No Personal Data**: We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information, search queries, or browsing history.

## How We Use Information
- **Local Storage Only**: Your search engine preferences are stored locally in your browser and synced across your devices via Chrome's sync service (if enabled).
- **No External Servers**: We do not send any data to external servers or third parties.

## Data Storage
- All settings are stored using Chrome's `chrome.storage.sync` API
- Data remains on your device and Google's Chrome sync service (if you have Chrome sync enabled)
- No data is stored on our servers

## Third-Party Services
- When you perform searches, you are redirected to the search engines you have configured (Google Keep, Google Tasks, Trello, etc.)
- Each search engine has its own privacy policy that governs your interaction with their services

## Permissions
- **Storage**: To save your search engine preferences
- **Tabs**: To open search results in new browser tabs

## Data Deletion
- Uninstalling the extension removes all stored preferences
- You can reset preferences anytime through the extension settings
